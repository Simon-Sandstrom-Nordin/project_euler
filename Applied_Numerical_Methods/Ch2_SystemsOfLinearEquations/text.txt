Cases for systems:
    1. Non-singular, M = N. usually perfect.
% equal number of row elements in matrix's column vectors as in image
% vector.

% solving the nonsingular case is ez in matlab. Ax = b <=> x = A^(-1)b
A = [1,2;3,4], b = [1,2], x = [y,z]
x = A \ b = A^(-1) * b = inv(A) * b = [0; .5]

    2. Underdetermined, M < N. Minimum norm solution. (?)
% underdetermined system, ex. [1,2,3; 4,5,6][x;y] = [1;2] ?
% more rows in matrix operating on vector than in the image of the vector.

    3.  Overdetermined, M > N. Least squares solution.
% overdetermined system, ex. [1,2; 3,4; 5,6][x;y] = [1;2;3;4]
% fewer rows -II-.
% coefficient matrix: matrix operating on the vector.

% solved in some sense by minimizing the norm of the residue vector.
% Solved ez in MatLab like first one, since "\" operator recognizes the
% overdeterminism and I think does the normal (not that (norm) normal)
% thing of taking Ax = b <=> x = (A'A)^(-1)A'b

"Matlab is just about thinking in terms of Matrices" - my instructor
Syntax notes:

clc; clear all; close all;  % just start every main program with this :).
%   % percentage sign indicates a comment line. "Code" won't be excecuted.
;   % supresses output
=   % declares variable or function or anything. Like ":=" in Go.
    % MatLab is a dynamically typed programming language (I take it)
    % since it is understood if the preceding symbol will represent
    % a variable, function handle, boolean, Logic matrix, string, etc.
[1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]   % Produces the dial matrix. Indicative of how
    % matrices are structured: ";" terminates the current row vector,
    % and initiates a new one. I don't know how to use these terms. But
    % [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9] would also have worked. Spaces = commas.
save test t e s t   % saves the values of t,e,s, & t in file test.mat
load test t e   % read values if t, e from file test.mat
x = input('Prompt') % Like in python. Allows user to input data via keybrd.
formats exist. format hex. format rat. % <- rational numbers, eg. 1/3.
    % rational numbers are fractions, gcd(nominator,denominator)=1
    % ... is not neccecary? ... ok. Just number that can be expressed as
    % fraction of two integers. I know this. I promise.
function y = f(x)   % functions are special reserved constants/ variables
y = x               % defined in MATLAB. 
end                 % f = @(x) x; % would be anonomous, meaning that it
                    % is not stored in a program file, but associated with
                    % a variable whose data type s function_handle.
                    % Useful for shell? or compact definition...?
.   % notes term-wise operation. [1,2] * [3,4]' = 11, scalar mult. Occurs.
'   % transposes vector, matrix.
while statement %   statement here can be something like counter < 10.

% ... alot of the raw training just getting the syntax down I feel I did
% with project Euler, so I'm moving on from this... 
% Note though: Characteristic is the integer part of a logarithm
               % Mantissa is the decmal part.
        % as to why this matters... ? but it's included so \_(*)_/

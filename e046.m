% lesson learnt:  5777 is the smallest odd composite number that
%                 cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice
%                 a square. Goldbach's other conjecture is false.
% (The conjecture {f√∂rmodan, opinion based on incomplete information},
% was that there was no such number).
